# GarOOpa System

This repository is the home of an uber-like service that runs on the web. This is all but a concept.

## Prerequisites

~~~bash
pip install flask flask-wtf
~~~

## Used technologies

We used Python 3.7 with Flask and WTForms, and HTML with Jinja2.
We also used the `datetime` package for the `now()` procedure, which behaves as a timestamp for each trip.

## The system

The system always starts with a single driver, Mr. Agnaldo de Freitas, as an example.
Feel free to modify him as your heart desires.

## Unit tests

All the back-end parts of the application have been unit-tested in the file `src/tests.py`.
